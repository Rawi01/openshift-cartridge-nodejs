# Custom Node.js cartridge for OpenShift

![nodejs-openshift](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/581999/12095822/1323a858-b31a-11e5-9ce7-aa47695f10d0.png)

# Forked from
    https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs

This is a custom Node.js cartridge that **takes care of auto-updating the Node.js and NPM versions** on each start.

By default, the Node.js version is determined by querying [semver.io/node/stable](https://semver.io/node/stable).

A different URL can be specified in your application's repository, in the `.openshift/NODE_VERSION_URL` file. For instance, you'd get the **latest 0.10** (0.10.39 as of June 29, 2015) by putting this in `.openshift/NODE_VERSION_URL`:

    https://semver.io/node/resolve/0.10.x

## Why

Because the standard OpenShift cartridge never gets updated to the latest Node.js version.

The original cartridge by icflorescu is designed as a primary cartridge. Therefore you have to use an additional gear for it. In my case I want to use Node.js as a small background worker which would lead to a waste of my free gears.

This cartridge add the current Node.js version as a secondary server.

## When to use

When you need a quick and unsofisticated solution to run your application on the latest Node.js version.

## How to ([web console](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications))

To install this cartridge in your existing OpenShift application, go to **"See the list of cartridges you can add"**, paste the URL below in **"Install your own cartridge"** textbox at the bottom of the page and click "Next".

    http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs

## How to (command line)

Assuming you have `rhc` installed (see [here](https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html)), run:

    rhc cartridge add -t http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs -a appname

...where `appname` is the name of your application.

See output of `rhc cartridge add --help` for information on additional options.

## Features

- The cartridge [build script](https://github.com/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/blob/master/bin/control#L11) is using [this function](https://github.com/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/blob/master/lib/util#L3) to check for the latest Node.js and npm versions and installs them if necessary;
- This cartridge **can** be scaled;
- This cartridge **does not** (yet?) have a hot-deploy strategy.

## Notes

- Can't guarantee this cartridge is production-ready. Some people use it though (on **their own responsibility**).
- This is a lean cartridge. No unnecessary modules are installed. Which means that - unlike the standard Node.js cartridge - it won't install [supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) for you. You'll have to implement your own logic to auto-restart on errors. The [provided application template](https://github.com/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/blob/master/usr/template/start.js) is using [cluster](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) for that.
- The cartridge emulates the execution of `npm start` to start your application, so **make sure your application entrypoint is defined in your start script of your `package.json` file**. See [`package.json` in the provided template](https://github.com/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/blob/master/usr/template/package.json) or read the [`npm` docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/start) for more information.
- Due to OpenShift's outdated gcc (**4.4.7** as of Jan 4 2016), **native modules (such as [pg-native](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-native)) won't compile on Node.js > 4.x. They'll only work on Node.js 0.10 and 0.12**. See [this issue](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/issues/12) for more info.
- Upon cartridge initialization, the Node.js binary package is downloaded and installed, which **may take a while**, depending on OpenShift server and network load. 2 - 3 minutes is quite often, but 5 - 10 minutes is not uncommon, especially for scalable multi-gear setups (if you specified "Scale with web traffic").

## FAQ

**Q**: I'm getting the error *Cannot download, must be smaller than 20480 bytes* while trying to deploy the cartridge to OpenShift. What am I doing wrong?

**A**: You're probably trying to use the URL `https://github.com/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs` instead of
`http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/Rawi01/openshift-cartridge-nodejs`. A common mistake for people not paying sufficient attention while trying to use a custom cartridge for the first time.

---

**Q**: The latest Node.js version is 5.3.0, but the cartridge installs 5.1.1. Isn't it supposed to install the **latest**?

**A**: By default, the Node.js version is determined by querying [semver.io/node/stable](https://semver.io/node/stable) (see the top of this README). For reasons which escape me, semver.io is not updating **instantly** the latest version, but **you can** force the cartridge to install it by putting, for instance, `https://semver.io/node/resolve/5.3.x` in `.openshift/NODE_VERSION_URL`.

---

**Q**: Sometimes, `git push` fails with:

    remote: CLIENT_MESSAGE: Stopping Node.js application...
    remote: CLIENT_RESULT: Warning! Could not stop Node.js application!
    remote: An error occurred executing 'gear prereceive' (exit code: 1)
    remote: Error message: CLIENT_ERROR: Failed to execute: 'control stop' for /var/lib/openshift/[...]/nodejs
    remote:
    remote: For more details about the problem, try running the command again with the '--trace' option.
    To ssh://[...].git/
     ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://[...].git/'

What's wrong?

**A**: Your application may take longer than 60 seconds to shutdown. Try to `git push` again until it works.
